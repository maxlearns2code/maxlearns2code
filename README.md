# 👋 Hi, I'm Maxime Dewynter

**Web Developer | Stockholm, Sweden**

## 🚀 About Me

After ten years in finance and HR in Paris, I transitioned into web development to build products instead of just managing processes. My focus is modern, accessible, and maintainable web applications with React, Next.js, and TypeScript, using Vercel for deployment, routing, and edge caching, and Node.js, Express, and Firebase/Firestore for real-world data needs.​

This mix of business and engineering helps me translate requirements into shipped features that feel intuitive to both stakeholders and end-users.

- **Location:** Stockholm, Sweden
- **Languages:** French (native), English (professional), Swedish (beginner)
